# Topic 1: Creative

In each category of the Creative topic, the task is to create a meaningful graph from data found on a specific website and visualize it in a suitable way. We will judge both the created graph itself and how it is visualized.

For the visualization of the graph, we leave it open as to how this can be done. It could be a typical drawing of the graph as a picture, a map-like drawing, an animation, an interactive tool, or whatever comes to mind. **Be creative!**

Your submission shall include the graph data itself (e.g., in a common graph file format or as a text file), the visualization (e.g., a PDF of the picture, a movie in a standard format, a link to a web page), and a PDF briefly describing how the graph and the visualization were obtained.
